                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">In web development, most people focus on the big budgets. New sites, complex applications, projects with deadlines, changing requirements, and a handover when it’s done. Then the client gets an invoice, and the team moves on.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">But what happens months or years later when something breaks?</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">Websites aren’t finished the day they go live. Code ages, packages get abandoned, plugins built by different developers introduce security problems, server architectures upgrade, and platforms move forward. Your website is your number one marketing channel or your primary sales tool, it should be maintained regularly.</p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">If you lose heating, you call a plumber. If the lights go out, you get an electrician. But when a contact form stops working or your homepage shows a server error, there’s no one obvious to call.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">In many cases, the original developer isn’t around anymore. Or they’ve moved on to bigger work. Maybe there were disagreements, or maybe they just don’t pick up small jobs. You’re left with a problem that no one wants to take on.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">That’s where I help.</p>

                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">Over the years, I’ve seen a gap in the market for people who look after websites, not just build them. Most developers prefer greenfield projects. I like the kind of work where you come in, fix something, and make someone’s life easier.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">I believe maintenance matters. It might not be glamorous, but it’s valuable. I believe fixing the small things keeps your website – and your business – strong.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 text-lg font-light text-neutral-700">If your site is broken, unstable, or just confusing to work with, I’m here to help you get it back under control.</p>

                    <p class="mb-6 font-light text-base/7 text-neutral-700">I’m a senior software developer with 24 years of hands-on experience, mostly working with PHP and modern web tech. I've built and maintained everything from content-heavy websites to complex backend systems — including a lot of legacy projects that needed stability and care.</p>
                    <p class="mb-6 font-light text-base/7 text-neutral-700">I work well in messy environments, and I’m comfortable modernising old code without rewriting everything from scratch. I believe in simplicity, clear communication, and writing software that lasts.</p>
